First, set up your [AWS configuration][config].
You can type `aws configure` (if you have the AWS CLI) or manually create the files.
On a shared account, you may need to create yourself an [IAM user][iam] with "programmatic access" to get an access key.
Use the `us-west-2` (Oregon) region.

Install the dependencies:

    $ pip install --user -r requirements.txt
