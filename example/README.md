# HammerBlade C API Example

This example demonstrates host and manycore code using HammerBlade's low-level C API. To use it, try running `make run`. This does three things:

1. Build the host program (`make host`).
2. Build the device code (`make main.riscv`).
3. Execute the whole thing (`./host main.riscv`).
